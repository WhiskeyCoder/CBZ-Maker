# CBZ Creator Script

This Python script automates the process of converting folders of image files into CBZ (Comic Book Zip) files. It is particularly useful for organizing and compressing collections of manga, comics, or any series of images into a single CBZ file for easy viewing in comic reader applications.

## Works Good On
- Comics
- Manga
- Scans of Book Pages

## Features

- Recursively processes a main directory to locate subdirectories containing image files.
- Creates a `CBZ_Files` folder in the main directory to store the generated CBZ files.
- Supports common image file formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and `.png`.
- Preserves the original folder structure in the CBZ output.

## How It Works

1. The script takes a main directory as input.
2. It walks through the directory structure to find subdirectories containing images.
3. For each subdirectory:
   - It sorts the image files by name.
   - Creates a CBZ file named after the folder.
   - Adds the images to the CBZ file.
4. The generated CBZ files are saved in a `CBZ_Files` folder within the main directory.

### Example

Given the following directory structure:
Main_Directory/ ├── Series1/ │ ├── page1.jpg │ ├── page2.jpg │ └── page3.jpg ├── Series2/ │ ├── cover.png │ ├── page1.png │ └── page2.png └── CBZ_Files/ (generated by the script)

After running the script, the `CBZ_Files` folder will contain:
CBZ_Files/ ├── Series1.cbz └── Series2.cbz


Each CBZ file will include the respective images from the original subdirectories.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install Python (if not already installed).
3. Copy the script to your desired directory.
4. Update the `main_directory` variable with the path to your main directory. Example:
   ```main_directory = r"C:\Users\user\Documents\Mangas\MANGA"```
5. Run the script:
```python cbz_creator.py```


## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or later.
- Ensure your directory structure is organized with images in subfolders.

## Notes
- Only .jpg, .jpeg, and .png images are included in the CBZ files.
- The script skips folders without images.
- The CBZ_Files directory is automatically created in the main directory if it doesn't already exist.

## Error Handling
- If the specified main directory is not valid, the script will print an error message and terminate.
- Folders without images are skipped, and a message is displayed.
